# FuxCP4

This repository contains the code for FuxCP, a constraint programming formalization of Fux's theory of counterpoint. It is part of our Master's thesis at UCLouvain. 
The FuxCP folder contains the C++ code that builds the constraint solver, and Common Lisp code for the interface with OpenMusic.

The Common Lisp code is built upon previous works by Thibault Wafflard and Anton Lamotte. 
The C++ code is built upon a base code provided by Damien Sprockeels.
